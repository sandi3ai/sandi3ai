- 👋 Hi, I’m @sandi3ai
- 👀 I’m interested in web development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS, ReactJS (frontend)
- 💞️ I am working as a QA engineer, just finishing my college thesis right now.
My biggest project so far was making an app for my former company,
that logs working hours, annual leaves, etc.
I enjoy learning new things, I like being challenged.
