# 👋 Hi, I’m @sandi3ai

🧪 I’m a QA Engineer with a strong passion for building clean and reliable software.  
💻 Alongside my QA work, I actively explore the dev world — React, TypeScript, and now React Native.  
🎓 Graduated with a degree in Computer Science, and I’ve been deep in the tech game ever since.  
📱 Built a full internal HR app (working hours, annual leave tracking) for my former company.  
🌱 Always curious, always learning — especially when it comes to building better user and test experiences.
